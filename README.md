## ğŸ’° Description ğŸ’°

A currency exchange application made for my Week 6 Independent Project at Epicodus Coding School focusing on API calls. 

A user can type in an amount (in U.S. dollars) and then choose from 5 other types of currency for it to be converted to. To determine the most recent exchange rate, the application will make an API call.

If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application will return a notification to the user that states what the error is.
